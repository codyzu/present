You came here for this talk...

<!-- +1 -->

...not the talk I'm going to give

<!-- +3 -->

Because I want to show cute animal pictures!

<!-- +4 -->

Worked with teams of researchers, simulating most advanced models, meta-study, supercomputers… to come to this conclusion:

Its exponential

<!-- +1 -->

Want to be zen:
- Curating a community
- Contributing to OSS projects

<!-- +1..+7 -->

Non OSS software typically carries 18-20% maintenance fees
- go towards opaque features that you don't have control over

OSS is 'free' but you can maintain your dependencies more efficiently and contribute to the ecosystem

Metaphor: renting vs buying a house and living in a community with neighbors

Think M$, can’t control what's coming in the next version, patches, fixes

You can count on the community: lots of stars = bigger community, faster fixes

<!-- +1 -->

Need to determine where you are, what the motivations are to level up

We want to level up

<!-- +1 -->

1. All closed source, commercially licensed software
1. Locked down deps
1. Open deps, no contribs
1. Empowering devs, contributing to ecosystem
1. Strategic and differentiating investment

<!-- +1..+2 -->

Do you have a website?

Do you build any internal software?

Mobile application?

#### Case study
Worked at employer who:
- rejected open source
- wanted to “own” all source code
- Saw source code as core “value” of products (fallacy)

<!-- +1..+2 -->

Imagine artifactory or similar tool

"my competitor will use my code without having to pay engineers".

#### Case Study
Worked at employer who:
- Had devops team that put in place artifactory
- Had to submit support ticket to get dependencies added
- Usually “no problem” - false sense of security

<!-- +1..+2 -->

InnerSource: buzzword, no real organized effort

#### Case Study
##### Employer who:
- Empowered devs to use open source
- Didn’t let us contribute back, preferred “private forks”

##### Client who:
- Wasn’t ready to OSS
- Said they were OK with InnerSource, but didn’t have upper management buy-in
- Lacked trust in devs, did not empower devs to contribute back to “InnerSource”

<!-- +1..+2 -->

#### Case Study
##### Employer who:
- Truly empowered employees to use and contribute back (startup: “just ship it”)
- Frustrating when not given time to do it right at contribute back

##### NearForm for many years:
- Embraced and contributed to OSS
- Node.js, Fastify, etc…
- Not really in an organized manner, client projects and billable hours priority

level 4, is not as strategic as possible. Not same potential to company and ecosystem

Improved cross team collaboration - team empowerment

Not optimized: finding strategic projects that bring value to org

<!-- +1..+10 -->

#### Case Study

##### Nearform:
- Starting to achieve level 5
- Lyra
- OSPO infancy

Not just making a repo public, building a community

<!-- +1 -->

Where is yours?

How many of each (show of hands)

<!-- +1 -->

OpenJSF

Open community with open slack & calendar, meetings are open, anyone can join and see how things work behind the scenes

Questions: where and how to get involved, what projects to get involved with

<!-- +2 -->

Professional services (consulting)

Walk the walk and talk the talk
